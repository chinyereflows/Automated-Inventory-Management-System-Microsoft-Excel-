# Automated-Inventory-Management-System-Microsoft-Excel-
An automated inventory management system built in Microsoft Excel that processes stock-in and stock-out transactions to generate real-time inventory levels, valuation, and low-stock alerts using dynamic formulas and pivot tables.
### Background
This project was developed to demonstrate how Microsoft Excel can be used to build a fully automated inventory management system. The system tracks every stock transaction and provides real-time updates on inventory levels, stock value, and movement, while also visually flagging low or out-of-stock items for quick decision-making.
### Project Objective
To design an easy-to-use, fully automated inventory management system solely in Microsoft Excel that:
- Tracks stock levels in real time
- Records stock-in and stock-out transactions
- Generates inventory summaries and order reports
- Minimizes manual data entry and eliminates hard-coding
### Dataset Description
- Sales and product data were randomly generated for demonstration purposes.
- The structure mirrors a real-world small business inventory workflow.
### Tools and Skills Used
- Microsoft Excel
#### Key Excel Techniques
- Pivot tables
   - Used to summarize inventory data, calculate current stock levels, and determine total stock value. Filters were applied to quickly identify low or out-of-stock items.
- INDEX + MATCH
  - Used to dynamically retrieve product details from the Product Master List, ensuring accurate and consistent data entry.
- SUMIF:
  - Used to aggregate and calculate stock quantities and stock value based on specific criteria.
- Logical Functions (IF, IFERROR, IFNA):
  - Implemented to handle errors, validate data, and ensure smooth automation.
- Conditional Formatting:
  - Applied to create visual alerts for low and out-of-stock items, enabling real-time monitoring at a glance.
### Template Features
- Product master list
- Stock-in sheet
- Stock-out sheet
- Master inventory tracker
- Order summary report
### Insights and Use Cases
